    description = Mission Computer Terminal: Lowne Aerospace Technology Development Division.\n\nWARNING\nAccess to pathfinder mission briefings requires appropriate security clearance.\n\nFROM: Kerbal Space Center - Surface Systems Division\nTO: Lowne Aerospace / Technology Development Team\nSUBJECT: Advanced Surface Mobility Systems Validation\n\nThe permanent research base planned for Ike will require advanced surface mobility systems capable of extended exploration operations around the base. Current rover technology is limited in range and payload capacity, necessitating next-generation systems for comprehensive surface operations.\n\nThis pathfinder will test advanced rover systems at the polar research station, where extreme conditions and operational isolation provide realistic validation of extended-range surface operations.\n\nYour objective is to deploy next-generation rover systems to the polar station, demonstrate extended range operations (10km+ from base), test modular attachment systems for scientific equipment, and prove coordinated operations between rover and base crew.
    
    notes = Technology Validation Requirements:\n\nAdvanced Rover Deployment\nDeploy next-generation rover to polar research station with enhanced mobility and range capabilities.\n\nExtended Range Operations\nDemonstrate extended range operations 10km+ from base to validate comprehensive surface exploration capability.\n\nModular Attachment Systems\nTest modular attachment systems for scientific equipment to enable mission-specific rover configurations.\n\nCoordinated Base Operations\nProve coordinated operations between rover and base crew, essential for integrated surface missions.
    
    synopsis = Validate advanced surface mobility systems through extended operations at polar research station.
    
    completedMessage = Outstanding success! Advanced surface mobility systems validated with proven extended-range capability. Modular attachments, autonomous navigation, and coordinated operations all demonstrated. Technology ready for deep space surface operations. RFP1.3c is now available.
