    description = Mission Computer Terminal: Lowne Aerospace Technology Development Division.\n\nWARNING\nAccess to pathfinder mission briefings requires appropriate security clearance.\n\nFROM: Kerbal Space Center - Launch Systems Division\nTO: Lowne Aerospace / Technology Development Team\nSUBJECT: Reusable Launch System Validation\n\nThe upcoming Duna deployment missions will require multiple heavy launches within tight transfer windows. To optimize costs and increase launch frequency, we need to validate reusable launch technology that can be rapidly refurbished and relaunched.\n\nThis pathfinder mission will test our reusable booster recovery systems and rapid turnaround procedures. Success will enable cost-effective deployment of multiple mission components during the Duna transfer window.\n\nYour objective is to demonstrate booster recovery via powered landing, refurbishment and preparation for reuse, and successful relaunch of the same hardware within 50 days. This will prove our ability to conduct rapid, cost-effective launch operations for the main deployment phase.
    
    notes = Technology Validation Requirements:\n\nBooster Recovery Systems\nDemonstrate first stage recovery via powered landing, proving reusable launch vehicle technology.\n\nRapid Refurbishment\nRefurbish and prepare recovered booster for relaunch within 50 days to validate rapid turnaround capability.\n\nRelaunch Demonstration\nSuccessfully relaunch the same booster with a new payload, proving reusability and cost efficiency.\n\nCost Efficiency Validation\nDemonstrate cost savings vs expendable systems through successful reuse of primary launch hardware.
    
    synopsis = Validate reusable launch system technology and rapid turnaround procedures for cost-effective deployment.
    
    completedMessage = Remarkable achievement! The reusable launch technology has been successfully validated with proven booster recovery and rapid relaunch capability. This technology will enable cost-effective deployment during the main mission phase. RFP1.1d is now available.
