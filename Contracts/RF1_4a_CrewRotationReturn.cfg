    description = Mission Computer Terminal: Lowne Aerospace Deep Space Operations Division.\n\nWARNING\nAccess to mission briefings and operation status reports requires appropriate security clearance.\n\nFROM: Kerbal Space Center - Crew Operations Division\nTO: Lowne Aerospace / Duna Operations Team\nSUBJECT: Long-Duration Crew Rotation Operations\n\nPersonnel deployed during the initial phases of Operation Red Frontier have now completed extended tours of duty in the Duna system. Medical monitoring indicates the need for crew rotation to maintain operational effectiveness and personnel health.\n\nUsing the proven KEV design and the newly established Kerbin Gateway Station, execute comprehensive crew rotation operations. Return long-deployed crews to Kerbin for medical evaluation and rest, while deploying fresh personnel to maintain operational continuity.\n\nThis mission establishes our permanent crew rotation protocols and demonstrates the Gateway Station's role as the logistics hub for sustained interplanetary operations.
    
    notes = Deployment Requirements:\n\nKerbin Gateway Operations\nUtilize proven Gateway Station (RFP1.4a) as staging point for crew rotation logistics.\n\nKEV Crew Transport\nExecute crew rotation using proven KEV design for efficient personnel transport.\n\nCrew Health Protocols\nDemonstrate crew health monitoring and mission debriefing protocols for long-duration deployments.
    
    synopsis = Execute crew rotation between Duna system and Kerbin using KEV and Gateway Station logistics.
    
    completedMessage = Crew rotation operations successful! Long-deployed personnel returned to Kerbin, fresh crews deployed to Duna system. Gateway Station proven as logistics hub. Sustained crew operations protocols established.
