    description = Mission Computer Terminal: \n\nWARNING\nAccess to pathfinder mission briefings requires appropriate security clearance.\n\nFROM: Kerbal Space Center - Launch Systems Division\nTO: Lowne Aerospace / Technology Development Team\nSUBJECT: Reusable Launch System Validation\n\nThe upcoming Duna deployment missions will require multiple heavy launches within tight transfer windows. Current expendable launch systems are inefficient for the scale of operations planned, necessitating reusable technology to reduce costs and increase launch frequency.\n\nThe communications constellation (RFP1.1a) and precision landing systems (RFP1.1b) have been designed as test payloads for this reusable launch system, allowing comprehensive validation of the complete launch-deploy-recover cycle.\n\nThis pathfinder mission will validate our reusable booster technology through powered landing recovery at KSC. The booster must deliver a payload to orbit while retaining sufficient fuel to return to the launch site with all engines intact.\n\nYour objective is to demonstrate a multi-engine booster core that can successfully deliver payload to orbit and return to KSC via powered landing. This will prove the fundamental technology needed for cost-effective deployment during the main Duna mission phase.
    
    notes = Technology Validation Requirements:\n\nMulti-Engine Booster Core\nDevelop reusable launch vehicle with minimum 3 engines capable of payload delivery and powered recovery.\n\nPayload Delivery Capability\nSuccessfully deliver payload to target orbit (100-200km) while preserving booster for recovery.\n\nPowered Landing Recovery\nDemonstrate controlled powered landing at KSC with engines intact and fuel remaining.\n
    
    synopsis = Validate reusable booster technology through orbital payload delivery and powered landing recovery at KSC.
    
    completedMessage = Outstanding achievement! Reusable launch technology successfully validated with proven payload delivery and powered landing recovery. Multi-engine booster demonstrated precise return to KSC with engines intact. Combined with validated communications and landing technologies, the complete launch system is ready for scaled deployment during interplanetary missions.
