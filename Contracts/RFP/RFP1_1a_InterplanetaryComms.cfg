    description = Mission Computer Terminal: Lowne Aerospace Technology Development Division.\n\nWARNING\nAccess to pathfinder mission briefings requires appropriate security clearance.\n\nFROM: Kerbal Space Center - Communications Technology Division\nTO: Lowne Aerospace / Technology Development Team\nSUBJECT: Communications Relay Architecture Validation\n\nBefore we commit to deploying communications infrastructure in the Duna system, we need to validate our relay constellation management technology. The challenges of maintaining continuous coverage across multiple orbital mechanics require thorough testing.\n\nThis pathfinder mission will test our communications relay architecture in the Kerbin system, where we can monitor performance closely and make adjustments before interplanetary deployment.\n\nYour objective is to deploy and operate a 3-satellite relay constellation that provides continuous coverage during various orbital configurations. This will prove our ability to coordinate multiple communications assets and maintain reliable data transmission under dynamic conditions.
    
    notes = Technology Validation Requirements:\n\nRelay Constellation Management\nDeploy 3 relay satellites in different Kerbin orbits to test coordination between multiple communications assets.\n\nContinuous Coverage Demonstration\nProve constellation maintains continuous coverage during orbital mechanics and satellite positioning changes.\n\nHigh-Gain Antenna Systems\nTest high-gain antenna systems and data transmission capabilities under various range and angle conditions.\n\nSatellite Coordination\nDemonstrate coordinated operations between multiple satellites including handoff procedures and redundant coverage.
    
    synopsis = Validate communications relay constellation technology in Kerbin system before interplanetary deployment.
    
    completedMessage = Excellent work! The communications relay constellation has successfully demonstrated continuous coverage and coordination capabilities. The technology is now validated for interplanetary deployment. RFP1.1b is now available.
