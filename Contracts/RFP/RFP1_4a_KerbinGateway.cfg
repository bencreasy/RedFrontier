    description = Mission Computer Terminal: Lowne Aerospace Technology Development Division.\n\nWARNING\nAccess to pathfinder mission briefings requires appropriate security clearance.\n\nFROM: Kerbal Space Center - Advanced Logistics Division\nTO: Lowne Aerospace / Technology Development Team\nSUBJECT: Interplanetary Logistics Hub Development\n\nPhase 2 operations will require a fundamental shift from surface-based launches to orbital logistics and asset reuse between systems. The expanding scope of interplanetary operations necessitates a dedicated logistics hub in high Kerbin orbit.\n\nThe Kerbin Gateway Station will serve as the centerpiece for all future interplanetary missions, providing staging, refueling, and coordination capabilities that eliminate the need for most surface launches. This facility will revolutionize our operational paradigm.\n\nYour objective is to establish the Gateway in high Kerbin orbit, demonstrate orbital logistics coordination, and validate the station as an interplanetary mission staging point for Phase 2 operations.
    
    notes = Technology Validation Requirements:\n\nInterplanetary Logistics Hub\nEstablish modular logistics station in high Kerbin orbit (2000-5000km) optimized for interplanetary mission staging.\n\nOrbital Asset Management\nDemonstrate fuel storage, transfer capabilities, and docking facilities for various vessel classes.\n\nAutomated Logistics Coordination\nTest automated resource management and logistics coordination essential for Phase 2 operations.
    
    synopsis = Establish Kerbin Gateway Station as centerpiece for Phase 2 orbital logistics and interplanetary operations.
    
    completedMessage = Revolutionary achievement! Kerbin Gateway Station operational as interplanetary logistics hub. Phase 2 orbital operations paradigm validated. Surface launch dependency eliminated for future missions. RFP1.4b is now available.
