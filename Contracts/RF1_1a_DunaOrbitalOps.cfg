    description = Mission Computer Terminal: Lowne Aerospace Deep Space Operations Division.\n\nWARNING\nAccess to mission briefings and operation status reports requires appropriate security clearance.\n\nFROM: Kerbal Space Center - Deep Space Science Division\nTO: Lowne Aerospace / Duna Operations Team\nSUBJECT: Duna Orbital Science Station Deployment\n\nThe Duna transfer window is now open. All pathfinder technologies have been validated, and we are cleared for deployment operations.\n\nYour primary objective is to deploy the orbital science station to Duna using the proven orbital platform technology validated in RFP1.1d. This station will serve as the cornerstone of our Duna system operations, providing science processing capabilities, crew support, and docking infrastructure for all future missions.\n\nThe modular design has been thoroughly tested in Kerbin orbit. Deploy the validated configuration to establish our permanent research presence in the Duna system.
    
    notes = Deployment Requirements:\n\nOrbital Platform Deployment\nDeploy the proven orbital platform technology (RFP1.1d) to establish primary research facility in Duna orbit.\n\nScience Processing Capability\nDemonstrate science lab operations and data processing to validate research infrastructure.\n\nDocking Infrastructure\nCreate docking capabilities for future operations including crew rotation and supply missions.\n\nCommunications Integration\nEstablish communications compatibility with the system-wide network being deployed in parallel missions.
    
    synopsis = Deploy proven orbital platform technology to establish Duna orbital science station.
    
    completedMessage = Duna orbital operations successfully established! The science station is operational and ready to support sustained research activities. Docking infrastructure ready for future missions.
