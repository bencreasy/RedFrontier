    description = Mission Computer Terminal: Lowne Aerospace Technology Development Division.\n\nWARNING\nAccess to pathfinder mission briefings requires appropriate security clearance.\n\nFROM: Kerbal Space Center - Heavy Launch Systems Division\nTO: Lowne Aerospace / Technology Development Team\nSUBJECT: Phase 2 Launch Capability Development\n\nPhase 2 operations will require launching fully-loaded nuclear stages and KEVs rather than conducting complex orbital assembly. Current launch systems lack the payload capacity to deploy these assets at full capability, limiting operational efficiency.\n\nSuperheavy reusable launch technology will enable direct deployment of fully-fueled nuclear stages and KEVs to the Kerbin Gateway Station, dramatically reducing mission complexity and increasing payload capacity for Phase 2 operations.\n\nYour objective is to develop superheavy launch capability with 50+ ton payload capacity, demonstrate booster recovery and reuse, and prove rapid turnaround operations essential for efficient Phase 2 mission deployment.
    
    notes = Technology Validation Requirements:\n\nSuperheavy Payload Capability\nDesign superheavy lift vehicle capable of 50+ ton payloads to high orbit for Gateway Station operations.\n\nReusable Operations\nDemonstrate booster recovery and reuse building on proven RFP1.1c technology with scaled-up systems.\n\nRapid Turnaround\nExecute rapid refurbishment and relaunch within 20 days to prove operational efficiency for Phase 2 deployment schedules.
    
    synopsis = Develop superheavy reusable launch capability for fully-loaded Phase 2 nuclear stages and KEVs.
    
    completedMessage = Historic achievement! Superheavy reusable launch system operational with proven 50+ ton capacity. Rapid turnaround validated. Phase 2 launch capability established. All RF1.4 pathfinder technologies now validated!
