    description = Mission Computer Terminal: Lowne Aerospace Technology Development Division.\n\nWARNING\nAccess to pathfinder mission briefings requires appropriate security clearance.\n\nFROM: Kerbal Space Center - Habitat Systems Division\nTO: Lowne Aerospace / Technology Development Team\nSUBJECT: Permanent Habitat Systems Validation\n\nThe successful sample analysis from RF1.2 has revealed material properties that warrant establishing a permanent research presence on Ike. Extended crew deployments in the Duna system require robust habitat systems capable of sustaining operations in challenging environments.\n\nBefore deploying permanent habitats to Ike, we must validate our habitat technology in extreme conditions. Kerbin's polar regions provide an ideal testing environment with harsh conditions, isolation, and limited solar exposure that simulate the challenges of extended deep space operations.\n\nYour objective is to establish a research station at Kerbin's north or south pole, demonstrate extended crew operations for 60 days, and validate all life support systems under extreme environmental conditions.
    
    notes = Technology Validation Requirements:\n\nPermanent Habitat Deployment\nEstablish research station at Kerbin's north or south pole using modular habitat components with integrated life support.\n\nExtreme Environment Operations\nMaintain crew operations for 60 days in polar conditions, simulating the challenges of extended deep space deployment.\n\nPower Generation Under Limited Solar\nTest power generation systems during polar night cycles when solar intensity is minimal.\n\nRemote Operations Protocols\nDemonstrate remote operations and emergency protocols essential for isolated deep space facilities.
    
    synopsis = Validate permanent habitat systems by establishing polar research station in extreme environment.
    
    completedMessage = Exceptional achievement! Polar research station has successfully validated permanent habitat technology. Extended crew operations, power management, and remote protocols all proven under extreme conditions. Technology ready for deep space deployment. RFP1.3b is now available.
