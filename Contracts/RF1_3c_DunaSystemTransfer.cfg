    description = Mission Computer Terminal: Lowne Aerospace Deep Space Operations Division.\n\nWARNING\nAccess to mission briefings and operation status reports requires appropriate security clearance.\n\nFROM: Kerbal Space Center - Crew Operations Division\nTO: Lowne Aerospace / Duna Operations Team\nSUBJECT: Permanent Crew Transport Capability\n\nWith permanent facilities now established throughout the Duna system, we require standardized crew transport capability for regular rotation and logistics support. The KEV technology validated in RFP1.3c will provide efficient, reusable crew transport between orbital and surface facilities.\n\nDeploy the proven KEV design to the Duna system to establish permanent crew rotation capability. The KEV will serve as our standardized crew transport platform, enabling regular personnel transfers and supply missions between all Duna system facilities.\n\nThis deployment establishes the foundation for sustained crew operations and prepares for future crew rotation missions planned in RF1.4.
    
    notes = Deployment Requirements:\n\nKEV Deployment\nDeploy proven KEV technology (RFP1.3c) to Duna system for permanent crew transport capability.\n\nCrew Transport Operations\nEstablish standardized crew transport between orbital facilities and surface installations.\n\nSystem Integration\nDemonstrate KEV compatibility with existing Duna orbital station and Ike research base infrastructure.
    
    synopsis = Deploy KEV to Duna system for permanent crew rotation and standardized transport operations.
