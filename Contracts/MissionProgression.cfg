    description = Mission Computer Terminal: Lowne Aerospace Deep Space Operations Division.\n\nWARNING\nAccess to mission briefings and operation status reports requires appropriate security clearance.\n\nFROM: Kerbal Space Center - Deep Space Science Division\nTO: Lowne Aerospace / Mission Planning Team\nSUBJECT: Contract Award - Duna Investigation Initiative\n\nThe Science Council has reviewed all submitted proposals for the Duna investigation mission and is pleased to inform you that Lowne Aerospace has been selected as the primary contractor.\n\nYour company's innovative approach to deep space operations and proven track record in complex mission execution make you the ideal partner for this scientific endeavor. The initiative has been assigned the codename "RED FRONTIER" and classified as a Priority Alpha mission.\n\nBefore committing to expensive interplanetary deployment, we will conduct comprehensive technology validation through pathfinder missions in the Kerbin system. This approach ensures mission success while minimizing risk and cost overruns.
