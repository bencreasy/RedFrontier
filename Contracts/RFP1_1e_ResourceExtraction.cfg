    description = Mission Computer Terminal: Lowne Aerospace Technology Development Division.\n\nWARNING\nAccess to pathfinder mission briefings requires appropriate security clearance.\n\nFROM: Kerbal Space Center - Resource Utilization Division\nTO: Lowne Aerospace / Technology Development Team\nSUBJECT: ISRU Systems Validation on Minmus\n\nSustained operations in the Duna system will require reliable in-situ resource utilization to reduce dependency on supply missions from Kerbin. Ike's low gravity and resource composition make it an ideal location for our first interplanetary ISRU facility, but we must validate our technology before interplanetary deployment.\n\nMinmus provides an excellent analog for Ike operations, with similar low gravity conditions and accessible resource deposits. This pathfinder mission will test our complete ISRU chain from ore extraction through fuel production and storage.\n\nYour objective is to deploy a comprehensive resource extraction facility on Minmus that demonstrates ore mining, fuel production, storage systems, and transfer operations. Success will validate our ISRU technology for deployment to Ike during the main mission phase.
    
    notes = Technology Validation Requirements:\n\nResource Extraction Operations\nLand resource extraction equipment on Minmus and demonstrate ore mining capability from surface deposits.\n\nFuel Production Systems\nDemonstrate ore processing and fuel production, producing minimum 200 units of fuel from local resources.\n\nStorage and Transfer Systems\nTest fuel storage systems and transfer operations to validate logistics support capability.\n\nAutonomous Operations\nProve facility can operate autonomously with minimal oversight, essential for interplanetary deployment.
    
    synopsis = Validate complete ISRU technology chain on Minmus as analog for Ike operations.
    
    completedMessage = Outstanding achievement! The resource extraction pathfinder has successfully validated all ISRU systems. Ore extraction, fuel production, and autonomous operations all proven on Minmus. All pathfinder technologies now validated - RF1.1 deployment missions are now available for the Duna transfer window!
