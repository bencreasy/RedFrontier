    description = Mission Computer Terminal: Lowne Aerospace Technology Development Division.\n\nWARNING\nAccess to pathfinder mission briefings requires appropriate security clearance.\n\nFROM: Kerbal Space Center - Nuclear Propulsion Division\nTO: Lowne Aerospace / Technology Development Team\nSUBJECT: Permanent Orbital Transfer Capability Development\n\nThe expanding operations in the Duna system require efficient cargo and personnel transfer between orbital facilities and surface installations. Current single-use transfer stages are inefficient for sustained operations, necessitating a reusable orbital transfer capability.\n\nWe are developing nuclear-powered reusable transfer stages that can operate indefinitely in space, providing permanent logistics capability between orbital facilities. These stages will revolutionize our approach to interplanetary logistics by eliminating the need for expendable transfer systems.\n\nYour objective is to develop a reusable nuclear transfer stage for Kerbin-Mun operations, execute minimum 3 round-trip missions without refurbishment, demonstrate automated docking and cargo transfer, and prove long-duration orbital storage capability. Success will establish permanent orbital transfer operations throughout our expanding infrastructure.
    
    notes = Technology Validation Requirements:\n\nReusable Nuclear Transfer Stage\nDesign reusable transfer stage using nuclear propulsion for extended operations capability.\n\nMultiple Mission Capability\nExecute minimum 3 round-trip missions without refurbishment to prove reusable design philosophy.\n\nAutomated Operations\nDemonstrate automated docking and cargo transfer essential for routine logistics operations.\n\nLong-Duration Storage\nTest in-space refueling, maintenance protocols, and long-duration orbital storage capability.
    
    synopsis = Develop permanent orbital transfer capability through reusable nuclear-powered transfer stage technology.
    
    completedMessage = Groundbreaking success! Reusable nuclear transfer stage technology has revolutionized orbital logistics capability. Multiple missions, automated operations, and long-duration storage all validated. Permanent orbital transfer operations now possible. All RF1.3 pathfinder technologies validated - deployment missions available!
