    description = Mission Computer Terminal: Lowne Aerospace Deep Space Operations Division. \n\nWARNING\nAccess to mission briefings and operation status reports requires appropriate security clearance.\n\nFROM: Kerbal Space Center - Deep Space Science Division\nTO: Lowne Aerospace / Duna Operations Team\nSUBJECT: Duna Surface Base & Interplanetary Logistics\n\nFollowing the successful establishment of the Ike Research Outpost during RF1.3, the Science Council has determined that the time is right to expand our presence to Duna's surface. The research conducted on Ike has provided crucial insights into the unique properties of Duna's composition, warranting direct on-site investigation that cannot be adequately conducted through remote operations alone.\n\nAdditionally, the expanding scope of our operations in the Duna system has highlighted the need for a more efficient logistics framework between Kerbin and Duna. The current approach of individual mission launches is becoming increasingly inefficient as our presence grows.\n\nThe Science Council has authorized RF1.4: "Duna Foothold," which will establish our first permanent presence on Duna's surface while simultaneously creating the Kerbin Gateway Station to serve as a logistics hub for all future interplanetary traffic.\n\nThis dual-focus mission represents a pivotal moment in our exploration efforts, transforming our approach from individual missions to sustained presence with permanent infrastructure spanning two planetary systems.
    
    notes = Comprehensive analysis of our operational needs has identified the following technical requirements:\n\nDuna Surface Base Establishment\nLanding large, integrated base components on Duna presents significant challenges due to the thin atmosphere, requiring specialized descent systems that balance aerodynamic and propulsive deceleration.\n\nResource Extraction Implementation\nSustained operations on Duna's surface require robust power generation capabilities that can function through dust storms and seasonal variations in solar intensity.\n\nKerbin Gateway Station Deployment\nCurrent mission architecture involves redundant launches and inefficient transfer of components, creating logistical bottlenecks and increasing costs.\n\nInterplanetary Transport System\nSurface-to-orbit transport between the Duna base and orbital facilities requires standardized, reusable vehicles to maintain operational continuity.
    
    synopsis = Establish Duna surface base and Kerbin Gateway Station for interplanetary logistics.
    
    completedMessage = Congratulations on completing Phase 1 of Operation Red Frontier! With permanent facilities now established on both Ike and Duna, and the Kerbin Gateway Station operational, we have successfully created the foundation for sustained presence in the Duna system. The Science Council has authorized progression to Phase 2 operations, which will focus on expanding our capabilities and establishing permanent command infrastructure. Near Future Electrical technologies have been unlocked for all future missions.
