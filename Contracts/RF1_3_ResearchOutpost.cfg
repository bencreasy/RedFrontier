    description = Mission Computer Terminal: Lowne Aerospace Deep Space Operations Division. \n\nWARNING\nAccess to mission briefings and operation status reports requires appropriate security clearance.\n\nFROM: Kerbal Space Center - Deep Space Science Division\nTO: Lowne Aerospace / Duna Operations Team\nSUBJECT: Permanent Ike Research Base Establishment\n\nThe successful collection and analysis of Duna surface samples during RF1.2 has yielded results that warrant immediate allocation of dedicated research resources. The anomalous material properties demonstrate unique characteristics that could revolutionize our approach to interplanetary propulsion and power generation.\n\nThe Science Council has authorized RF1.3: "Research Outpost," the next phase of Operation Red Frontier. This mission will focus on establishing a permanent, crewed research facility on Ike to support ongoing analysis and experimentation. Ike's low gravity environment and proximity to Duna make it an ideal location for a permanent base, offering significant advantages in terms of landing/ascent delta-V requirements while providing convenient access to Duna for future operations.\n\nThis mission represents our transition from exploratory investigations to a sustained research presence in the Duna system. The infrastructure established during RF1.3 will serve as the foundation for all future operations in this region of space.
    
    notes = Analysis of long-term research requirements has identified the following technical needs:\n\nPermanent Habitat Establishment\nCurrent temporary facilities on Ike lack the laboratory space and power generation capabilities necessary for advanced research operations.\n\nEnhanced Resource Processing\nSustainable operations demand expanded resource processing capabilities to reduce dependency on supply missions from Kerbin.\n\nPower Infrastructure Development\nLong-term scientific operations require stable power generation in varying conditions, including Duna eclipses.\n\nSurface Mobility Enhancement\nExtended crew deployments require dedicated habitation facilities beyond the limited accommodations currently available.
    
    synopsis = Establish a permanent research base on Ike to study the unique material properties discovered during RF1.2.
    
    completedMessage = Excellent work! The Ike Research Outpost is now operational, providing a permanent scientific presence in the Duna system. The unique environment of Ike will enable groundbreaking research that was impossible with previous temporary facilities.
