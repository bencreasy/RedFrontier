# Red Frontier Campaign for Kerbal Space Program

## Overview
Red Frontier is a narrative-driven progression framework for Kerbal Space Program designed to create meaningful objectives and storytelling opportunities. The campaign centers around the discovery of an anomalous radiation signature on Duna, prompting Lowne Aerospace (as a KSC contractor) to establish a permanent presence in the Duna system and ultimately expand throughout the Kerbol system.

This contract pack implements the Red Frontier campaign as a series of progressive missions, each building upon the infrastructure and capabilities established in previous missions.
