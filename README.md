# **RED FRONTIER**

## **A 12-MONTH KERBAL SPACE PROGRAM CHALLENGE**

### **CAMPAIGN OVERVIEW**

Red Frontier is a narrative-driven progression framework for Kerbal Space Program designed to create meaningful objectives and storytelling opportunities within the open sandbox environment. The campaign centers around the discovery of an anomalous electromagnetic signature detected through advanced magnetometer technology, leading to the investigation of unusual readings from the Duna system and ultimately establishing a permanent presence throughout the Kerbol system.

This campaign features a progressive pathfinder and deployment structure, designed to be played and documented over approximately 12 months. Rather than following a rigid monthly schedule, the campaign adapts to transfer windows and player pace, with pathfinder missions filling the gaps between optimal deployment windows. The framework provides both technical objectives and narrative elements, enabling a measured and rewarding gameplay experience while creating compelling content for viewers.

### **CAMPAIGN STRUCTURE**

The Red Frontier Campaign is divided into four distinct phases, utilizing a pathfinder and deployment methodology:

**PHASE 0: DISCOVERY** - *Initial Investigation*
- RF0.1: "Strange Signals" - Magnetometer technology development and anomaly detection
- RF0.2: "Strange Signals II" - Deep space investigation revealing Duna system origin

**PHASE 1: DUNA SYSTEM ESTABLISHMENT** - *Technology Validation and Deployment*
- **Pathfinder Development**: Technology validation missions in Kerbin system (RFP series)
- **Deployment Operations**: Concurrent application of proven technology during transfer windows (RF series)
- **Progressive Structure**: Each deployment phase requires completion of all relevant pathfinder technologies

**PHASE 2: SYSTEM EXPANSION** - *Advanced Infrastructure and Orbital Operations*
- Focus: Transitioning from surface-based to orbital logistics paradigm
- Gateway Station as primary mission origin point
- Enhanced infrastructure using Near Future technology suite

**PHASE 3: SYSTEM-WIDE EXPLORATION** - *Comprehensive System Presence*
- Focus: Leveraging established infrastructure to explore entire Kerbol system
- Advanced propulsion and interstellar precursor technology

### **PATHFINDER AND DEPLOYMENT METHODOLOGY**

The campaign employs a unique two-phase approach to mission execution:

**PATHFINDER MISSIONS (RFP Series)**
- Conducted in Kerbin system for close observation and refinement
- Validate critical technologies before expensive interplanetary deployment
- Fill time between optimal transfer windows
- Sequential progression ensuring technology readiness
- Examples: Communications relay testing, precision landing validation, KEV development

**DEPLOYMENT MISSIONS (RF Series)**
- Execute during optimal transfer windows using proven pathfinder technology
- Multiple concurrent objectives maximize transfer window efficiency
- Focus on operational success rather than technology development
- Build comprehensive infrastructure through coordinated deployment

### **TECHNOLOGY PROGRESSION**

The campaign emphasizes realistic technology development through proven advancement:

**Phase 1 Technologies**
- Communications relay networks
- Precision landing systems
- Reusable launch capability
- Orbital platform operations
- Resource extraction and processing
- Deep drilling and sample return
- Permanent habitat systems
- Advanced surface mobility
- **Kerbal Expedition Vehicle (KEV)**: Developed through RFP1.3c, adopted as standard crew transport
- **Nuclear Transfer Stages**: Heavy logistics capability for cargo transport
- **Gateway Station**: Orbital logistics hub for Phase 2 operations
- **Superheavy Launch**: Enables fully-loaded vehicle deployment

**Mod Integration Timeline**
- **Core Phase 1**: Stockalike Station Parts, Planetary Base Systems
- **Phase 1 Completion**: Near Future Electrical unlocks
- **Phase 2 Beginning**: Full Near Future suite deployment
- **Phase 3**: Advanced propulsion and potential Interstellar mod integration

### **MISSION FLOW EXAMPLE - PHASE 1**

**Technology Development Phase**
- RFP1.1a through RFP1.1e: Validate communications, landing, reusable launch, orbital platforms, ISRU
- Time: Fills gap before Duna transfer window

**Deployment Phase**
- RF1.1a-d: Concurrent deployment of validated technologies during transfer window
- Establish: Duna orbital station, communications network, surface probes, Ike resource facility

**Next Technology Development**
- RFP1.2a through RFP1.2c: Validate drilling, sample return, enhanced ISRU
- Time: Fills gap before next transfer window

**Advanced Deployment**
- RF1.2a-c: Deploy drilling operations, sample return, enhanced facilities
- Continue progression through RF1.3 (permanent habitats) and RF1.4 (surface base)

### **CAMPAIGN PACING**

**Flexible Timeline**: Approximately 12 months total, but adapts to player pace and transfer windows
**Mission Density**: 50+ individual contracts providing frequent sense of accomplishment
**Transfer Window Optimization**: Major deployments timed for maximum efficiency
**Technology Validation**: Ensures mission success through proven technology progression
**Narrative Continuity**: Each mission builds logically on previous achievements

### **STRATEGIC INFRASTRUCTURE DEVELOPMENT**

**Phase 1 Achievements**
- Complete Duna system infrastructure from orbital facilities to surface presence
- Validated technology suite ready for system-wide deployment
- Established crew rotation and logistics protocols
- **KEV Fleet**: Standardized crew transport throughout the system
- **Nuclear Logistics Network**: Heavy cargo capability between all facilities
- **Gateway Station**: Orbital operations hub eliminating surface launch dependency

**Phase 2 Preparation**
- Orbital logistics paradigm established
- Asset reuse between systems rather than single-use deployment
- Advanced power generation (Near Future Electrical) proven
- Foundation for outer system exploration

### **CONTENT CREATION CONSIDERATIONS**

For YouTube presentation:
- **Frequent Content**: 50+ contracts provide regular episode material
- **Clear Progression**: Technology validation â†’ deployment provides natural story arc
- **Visual Development**: Infrastructure grows systematically across multiple worlds
- **Concurrent Operations**: Multiple simultaneous missions create dynamic content
- **Technology Showcase**: Progressive introduction of advanced mods and capabilities
- **Milestone Achievements**: Major infrastructure completions provide dramatic episode conclusions

### **CAMPAIGN PHILOSOPHY**

Red Frontier emphasizes **systematic infrastructure development** over individual heroic missions. Players develop comprehensive technological capabilities through careful validation before committing to expensive interplanetary deployment. The campaign rewards **operational thinking** - building sustainable infrastructure, reusing assets, and creating logistics networks rather than one-off exploration missions.

The pathfinder methodology ensures **high success rates** for main deployment missions while providing engaging content during transfer window gaps. This approach mirrors real space program development, where technology is thoroughly proven before major mission commitments.

**Technology adoption** follows realistic progression - the KEV emerges from operational needs, proves itself through testing, and becomes the standard platform. Similarly, Gateway Station begins as pathfinder validation and becomes the cornerstone of Phase 2 operations.

This framework provides structure while allowing for creative interpretation and personalization, making each playthrough unique while maintaining core progression and narrative coherence.
